# Student Data Management Application

This is a command-line application designed to manage and organize student data. The application provides functionality for storing student information in binary search trees (BST and AVL), as well as organizing data in min and max heaps, with various features to manipulate and retrieve student records. Each student entry includes an ID, name, GPA, and department.

## Features

The application offers the following features:

1. **Add a Student**
   - You can add a student to the data structure by specifying their ID (ranging from 0 to 100), name, GPA, and department.

2. **Remove a Student**
   - Students can be removed by providing their ID.

3. **Search for a Student**
   - You can search for a student by their ID. If the student is found, their information, including name, GPA, and department, will be displayed.

4. **Print All and Department Report**
   - This option allows you to retrieve all student information sorted by ID. Additionally, a department report is generated, providing a count of students per department.

5. **Sort Students by GPA**
   - Students can be inserted into min or max heaps based on their GPA. This allows you to access students sorted by their GPA, with an accompanying department report that displays the number of students in each department.

## Usage

Here's how you can use the application:

- Run the application.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations on the student data.
